//! The global primary-key dictionary: an append-only, bidirectional `pk string ↔ u32 id`
//! interner, one instance per engine.
//!
//! The membership circuit (`crate::subq_circuit`) and its registry (`crate::subquery`) key every
//! relation by primary key. Storing the pk as a heap `String` in each circuit entry AND each
//! registry index entry — once per relation, per feed/node — was the dominant per-entry cost
//! (a large share of the membership footprint). This
//! dictionary stores each distinct pk string exactly ONCE globally and hands out a `u32` id used
//! as the in-circuit / in-index key, so a per-feed entry drops to 8 B (its `(feed_id, pk_id)` key)
//! and the string is amortized across every feed/node that references it.
//!
//! **Append-only (no eviction in v1):** an id, once minted, is never freed or reused — matching
//! the feed-id / node-id non-reuse precedent (a stale snapshot read can never alias a new
//! meaning). The reverse table is therefore `O(distinct pks ever synced)`; its own footprint is
//! reported as `bytes_pk_dict` in `GET /memory` so the trade is visible.
//!
//! **Locking — single `RwLock` per table, not sharded:** the reverse table is a `Vec` indexed by
//! id, so a new id's slot MUST equal the current `Vec` length at mint time. A single write-locked
//! section makes "id = reverse.len(); reverse.push(pk); forward.insert(pk, id)" atomic with no
//! cross-shard id-allocation coordination and no holes in the reverse `Vec`. The common case —
//! a pk already interned — is a lock-free-of-writers *read* on the forward map (`get_or_insert`'s
//! fast path) and `resolve` is a pure reverse read, so the write lock is contended only on the
//! genuinely-first sync of each distinct pk. Sharding the forward map would buy nothing here (the
//! bottleneck is the shared, ordered reverse table, not forward-map hashing) while complicating
//! the append-only reverse invariant — so a single lock per table is the deliberate choice.
