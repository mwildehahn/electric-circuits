//! electric-circuits engine binary: a durable-streams client that incrementally maintains shapes
//! (key routing + stateless predicate evaluation over Z-set deltas).
//!
//! Boot configuration is resolved from the environment by [`electric_circuits_engine::config`], which maps
//! the benchmarking-fleet's `ELECTRIC_*` / `DATABASE_URL` surface onto the engine's `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_*`
//! internals (the latter still win, preserving the dev/test workflow). The durable-streams base URL
//! comes from `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL`; the engine binds `0.0.0.0:$ELECTRIC_PORT` (default 3000 under the
//! fleet, `127.0.0.1:0` in dev). Two stdout lines are the discovery channel: `ENGINE_BINDING <url>`
//! when the port is open (before Postgres is contacted, so `GET /ready` is answerable while the boot
//! is still retrying) and `ENGINE_LISTENING <url>` once the boot has RESOLVED.
//!
//! ## Exit codes
//!
//! | code | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `0` | clean exit: a graceful shutdown completed inside its grace period |
//! | `70` | the shutdown was **forced** — a second signal arrived, or the grace period elapsed with work still in flight ([`shutdown::EXIT_SHUTDOWN_FORCED`]). A catalog append being retried through an outage is a named party here |
//! | `71` | shutdown reached its final durable-catalog drain but the checkpoint or source receipt did not land inside the remaining grace; the next boot may replay, so this is explicitly incomplete rather than a clean exit |
//! | `74` | the durable catalog **refused** an event (`EX_IOERR`): storage answered, and the answer will not change. Memory and storage disagree and only a re-fold at boot can reconcile them, so the process exits instead of serving state its record does not describe |
//! | `75` | a counts pipeline must be rebuilt (schema drift or an epoch reset on a circuit-served table); restart to re-seed it |
//! | `78` | **boot refused** (`EX_CONFIG`): a misconfiguration retrying cannot fix — a setting the config resolver rejected (an unparseable `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL`, an unusable `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES`, an out-of-range byte budget, a missing `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL`, an unwritable spill directory), or a fatal Postgres condition — bad credentials, a missing privilege, an unknown database, `wal_level` ≠ `logical`, a publication with a column list, an unreadable durable catalog |
//!
//! A **retryable** Postgres condition — connection refused, DNS, a timeout, "the database system is
//! starting up" — is not an exit at all: the boot backs off (1 s → 30 s, jittered) and tries again
//! forever, answering `GET /ready` with `503 {"status":"waiting"}` throughout. Kubernetes gates
//! traffic on readiness, so a restart buys nothing an operator would want.
