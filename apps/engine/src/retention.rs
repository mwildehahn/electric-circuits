//! Shape retention: the three-tier lifecycle (active / dormant / evicted) and its layered,
//! dormant-only eviction policy.
//!
//! Replaces delete-on-refcount-0 (extended API) and the "handle TTL drops the shape" behavior of
//! the `/v1/shape` adapter as the primary lifecycle (a deliberate divergence from upstream
//! Electric, which keeps every retained shape actively maintained):
//!
//! - **Active** — maintained live by a tailer. Refcount-0 / client disconnect does NOT deactivate;
//!   brief reconnects stay warm and rejoin the same stream.
//! - **Dormant** — after sitting idle (no engine-visible reads and refcount 0) for
//!   [`RetentionConfig::idle_timeout`]: the tailer's routing state for the shape is dropped, while
//!   the durable stream and the shape record are retained at zero engine cost. Any touch
//!   reactivates by replaying the global change log from the captured resume **position** —
//!   `(segment, offset)`, following rotation pointers across segments (ADR-0006) — with no Postgres
//!   backfill (see `Engine::ensure_active`). While dormant a shape PINS its resume segment against
//!   deletion; one that would pin it past `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_CHANGES_RETAIN_SECS` is evicted
//!   ([`EvictReason::ChangeLogRetention`]) so the segment can go.
//! - **Evicted** — stream and record deleted; a returning `/v1/shape` client gets `409
//!   must-refetch` and re-snapshots, an extended-API client gets `404` and recreates.
//!
//! Eviction is **layered** and applies to dormant shapes only (active shapes are never evicted),
//! least-recently-read first:
//! 1. **Dormancy TTL** (hygiene): dormant longer than [`RetentionConfig::dormant_ttl`] → evict.
//!    Reaps dead shapes even with no resource pressure.
//! 2. **`max_shapes` count cap** (engine cost bound): when the total shape count exceeds
//!    [`RetentionConfig::max_shapes`], evict least-recently-read dormant shapes until under.
//! 3. **Disk budget** (hard backstop): when the tracked shape-stream bytes exceed
//!    [`RetentionConfig::disk_budget_bytes`], evict least-recently-read dormant shapes until
//!    under. Byte accounting is engine-side ([`crate::ds::DsClient`] counts what it appends) —
//!    the durable-streams server exposes no per-stream sizes yet — so it undercounts streams
//!    written before the current process started.
//!
//! If a cap/budget is exceeded but nothing dormant is left to evict, the sweep logs loudly and
//! bumps a metric instead of evicting active shapes.
//!
//! Subquery and aggregate shapes are exempt from dormancy (their engine state — inner-set
//! arrangements, running folds — cannot be rebuilt from a change-log replay alone), so they stay
//! active while retained. So that they cannot leak forever once unsubscribed, the TTL layer evicts
//! them **straight from active** (full teardown) after the same total grace an eligible shape gets
//! (idle timeout + dormancy TTL); like any evicted shape, a returning client recreates them.
//!
//! This module holds the configuration, the lifecycle state machine types, and the **pure** sweep
//! planner ([`plan_sweep`]); `crate::engine` owns the state and executes plans. Persistence of the
//! lifecycle (catalog, `last_read` flushes, restart recovery) is the follow-up catalog work (GH
//! issue #8). Dormancy IS durable: the engine's `meta/catalog` records `Dormant`/`Reactivated`
//! events (with the resume position + snapshot gate), so a restart restores dormant shapes as
//! dormant — no re-registration, no backfill. Only the in-memory clocks reset (dormancy age
//! restarts at boot, so the TTL is conservative across restarts).
