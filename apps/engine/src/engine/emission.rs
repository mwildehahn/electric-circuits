//! Ordered emission lanes for subquery-shape appends.
//!
//! The registry's correctness rule is that, per shape stream, **append order equals
//! membership-evaluation order** — a move evaluated at t₁ must never land after an emission
//! for the same pk evaluated at t₂ > t₁, or the stream's last word is stale (permanent
//! divergence). The old implementation guaranteed this by holding the registry lock across
//! the `append_reliable` network call; these lanes give the same guarantee without network
//! under the lock:
//!
//!   * emitters **enqueue under the registry lock** — so per-stream enqueue order is exactly
//!     eval order — and return immediately;
//!   * each stream path hashes to ONE lane (a FIFO drained by one writer task), so batches
//!     for a stream land in enqueue order;
//!   * appends use `append_reliable` (retry-until-landed; the only non-retried case is a retired
//!     stream — 404/410/`stream-closed` — the shape was dropped or evicted, discard is correct).
//!
//! The convergence barrier: every enqueued batch increments the shared `pending` counter
//! (the engine's `pendingFlips` term) and decrements it only after the append **landed**, so
//! "`pendingFlips == 0`" still means every subquery effect is on its stream — queued batches
//! included. Increment-before/at-enqueue happens while the emitter still holds its own
//! accounting (a `FlipWork` token stays >0 until its batches are enqueued), so the counter
//! never dips to zero with effects in flight.
