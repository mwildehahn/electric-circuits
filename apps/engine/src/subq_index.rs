//! The necessary-conjunct index over **subquery outer shapes** — the routing structure that makes
//! a change to a subquery shape's outer table cost `O(candidates)` instead of `O(#subquery shapes)`.
//!
//! Before this, `SubqueryRegistry::on_table_delta` step 2 scanned the whole global `shapes` map,
//! filtered by `outer_table`, and handed every survivor to `emit_for_shapes`, which re-evaluates the
//! FULL predicate per shape per touched pk. That was the one hot path left in the engine whose
//! per-change cost scaled with subscription count — every other tier is index-routed
//! (`engine::executors::KeyRouter`, `engine::executors::StandaloneIndex`).
//!
//! **Why a separate structure rather than reusing [`StandaloneIndex`](crate::engine::executors::StandaloneIndex).**
//! The two indexes answer different questions and would not collapse cleanly:
//!
//!  * `StandaloneIndex` is *per table already* — the sequencer holds one per table executor — so it
//!    has no table bucket. Subquery shapes all live in ONE global registry map keyed by shape id,
//!    across every outer table, so bucketing by outer table is the first thing this index must do
//!    and the first thing `StandaloneIndex` must not grow.
//!  * `StandaloneIndex`'s posting lists are `Vec<String>` and its probe returns `Vec<String>` built
//!    from a `HashSet<&str>`. Here the posting lists are [`RoaringBitmap`]s over **interned dense
//!    `u32` shape ids** (the [`crate::pk_dict`] interning pattern, applied to shape ids): the
//!    range-bound prefix scan unions whole posting lists in one pass instead of concatenating
//!    `Vec<String>`s, the eq ∪ lower ∪ upper ∪ scan candidate set dedups for free, and per-shape
//!    membership costs a couple of bits instead of a heap `String` clone per probe. Retrofitting
//!    that onto `StandaloneIndex` would mean changing the standalone and aggregate probe paths
//!    (`engine::sequencer` `shape_index`/`agg_index`) in the same change — destabilising two
//!    working tiers for a refactor. So: shared *extraction* logic
//!    ([`crate::predicate::CompiledPredicate::access_leaf`], the one definition of "necessary
//!    conjunct"), separate *storage*.
//!
//! **The correctness rule this index must not break.** Subquery outer membership is emitted
//! **absolutely**, not as a delta (`docs/ivm-engine-internals.md` §3.3, "The critical correctness
//! rule"): `emit_for_shapes` emits the *current* membership of every touched pk — an upsert if it
//! matches now, else a delete that the per-feed Roaring gate ([`crate::subq_feed`]) drops if the pk
//! was never a member. Skipping a shape because the **new** row image fails its indexed conjunct
//! would therefore silently drop the move-out delete for a row that was a member a moment ago.
//!
//! So [`SubqueryShapeIndex::candidates`] probes over the **raw Z-set delta**, whose `-1` tuples are
//! the row's old image and whose `+1` tuple is the new one (see `engine::output::apply_envelope`,
//! which builds updates as `[(old, -1), (new, +1)]` under `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`). The candidate
//! set is thus the union over old ∪ new images, and the safety argument closes inductively: a pk is
//! in a shape's feed only because it matched at its last evaluation, which means the image that made
//! it a member is exactly the `-1` old image of the *next* delta touching that pk — so that delta
//! always makes the shape a candidate and the move-out is always emitted. (A table whose
//! `REPLICA IDENTITY` is not `FULL` carries no old image; `replication.rs` already logs that loudly
//! and the delta-based standalone/router tiers are equally degraded there — it is a pre-existing
//! whole-engine assumption, not something this index newly relies on.)
//!
//! Two more things `access_leaf` guarantees, which this index depends on and
//! [`tests::in_leaves_are_never_a_necessary_conjunct`] pins:
//!
//!  * a **subquery `IN` leaf is never returned** — its truth depends on node state, not on the row
//!    alone, so it is not a valid index key. `access_leaf` only ever returns
//!    `CompiledPredicate::Cmp` leaves, and `InSubquery` is a different variant.
//!  * a leaf under a **negation** (`NOT IN`, or any `Not{…}` wrapper) is never returned — the walk
//!    descends only through `And` chains, so a `Not` node yields nothing and its shape falls to the
//!    unconditional `scan` list.
