# Rust structure map

## Current baseline

- The root is a virtual Cargo workspace with one member: `apps/engine`.
- `apps/engine` supplies both the `electric_circuits_engine` library and the
  `electric-circuits-engine` binary. Keeping this as one deployable package is an intentional
  option, not technical debt by definition.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pins Rust 1.96.0 because newer stable compilers have an upstream compiler
  ICE while compiling the current dbsp version. Do not float it or change related Cargo policy in
  an incidental refactor.
- `Cargo.lock` is committed. The engine directly pins a dbsp/rkyv/size-of compatibility group;
  inspect its feature graph before changing any member.
- The current package uses edition 2024, while the virtual workspace explicitly selects resolver
  2. Treat a resolver move as a separately reviewed graph change.

## Engine ownership map

| Area | Principal code | Structural concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine kernel | `apps/engine/src/engine/` | Sequencing, lifecycle, catalog, memberships, planning, and delivery have shared atomicity/lifecycle rules. Do not split them casually. |
| Circuit tier | `arrangements.rs`, `subq_circuit.rs` | Fixed deploy-time pipelines; their structure must not scale with shapes or subscriptions. |
| Query/domain representation | `predicate.rs`, `schema.rs`, `value.rs`, `table_ref.rs`, `sql.rs`, `where_sql.rs` | Candidate low-level contract boundary only after real dependency and API evidence. |
| Source/storage adapters | `pg.rs`, `replication.rs`, `pgoutput.rs`, `ds.rs`, `changelog.rs` | Postgres remains authoritative; durable-stream semantics retain ordering and retirement guarantees. |
| Client/wire adapters | `http.rs`, `electric.rs`, `params.rs`, `main.rs` | Composition and protocol edges should depend inward; a wire surface need not expose implementation helpers. |
| Cross-table runtime registry | `subquery.rs` | Shares inner-set nodes and coordinates absolute emission; preserve atomic rollback and deferred-flip convergence. |

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §14 and `docs/ivm-engine-internals.md` §7 for the current detailed
file map. For changes touching a row path, re-read the architecture consistency table and the
applicable ADR before deciding the package/module seam.

## Intended direction

```text
contracts and domain values
          ↑
query semantics and engine kernel
          ↑                 ↑
Postgres/streams adapters   dbsp circuit adapter
          ↑                 ↑
HTTP/Electric adapters and binary composition root
```

The arrows mean “depends on.” A port belongs at the boundary that consumes it. Runtime shape,
cohort, and query-template cardinality belongs in data/routing, never in Cargo topology.
