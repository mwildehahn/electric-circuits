# Deploying electric-circuits with Postgres

electric-circuits can run **Postgres as the system of record**: your application writes to Postgres
normally, and electric-circuits keeps every declared shape (a filtered view of a table) live by ingesting
changes from Postgres **logical replication** and reading rows back from Postgres for backfill. There
is no separate write API and no in-memory table copy to keep in sync — Postgres is the source of truth.

```

                     └──────────── backfill SELECT ──────┘                         │
                                                                                   ▼
                                                                          client (live rows)
```

## What you need

- **Postgres 10+** with logical decoding (the built-in `pgoutput` plugin — no extensions to
  install). Managed Postgres works if it allows `wal_level = logical` and a logical replication slot
  (RDS, Cloud SQL, Supabase, Neon, etc. all do).
- **A durable-streams server** (the transport/persistence layer). Set its base URL in
  `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL`.
- **The engine binary** (`apps/engine`, Rust): `cargo build -p electric-circuits-engine --release` →
  `target/release/electric-circuits-engine`.

## Step 1 — Configure Postgres

Logical replication must be on. In `postgresql.conf` (or your provider's parameter group):

```conf
wal_level = logical
max_replication_slots = 10     # ≥ number of engine instances
max_wal_senders = 10
```

Then restart Postgres (the `wal_level` change requires a restart).

The engine sets everything else up for you on startup, per configured table:

- `ALTER TABLE <t> REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` — so an UPDATE/DELETE carries the **full old row** (needed to
  compute the exact delta). The role you connect with must own the tables (or be superuser) for this.
- `pg_create_logical_replication_slot('<slot>', 'pgoutput')` + `CREATE PUBLICATION <slot>_pub FOR
  ALL TABLES` (superuser) — the replication slot and its publication, created once
  and reused.

> **Each table needs a single-column primary key.** The engine introspects columns, types, and the pk
> from the catalog; composite primary keys are not supported.

> **One slot per engine instance.** Replication-slot names are unique across the whole Postgres
> instance. If you run more than one engine against the same database, give each a distinct
> `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_SLOT`.

## Step 2 — Run the engine

Point it at Postgres, list the tables to watch, and give it the durable-streams URL:

```sh
export ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL="https://streams.internal:8080"
export ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL="postgres://user:pass@db.internal:5432/appdb"
export ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES="users,projects,reporting.tasks"
export ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_BIND="0.0.0.0:9000"

./electric-circuits-engine
```

On startup the engine introspects each table, sets `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, ensures the slot, starts
the replication ingestor, and begins serving the control API on `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_BIND`. It prints
`ENGINE_LISTENING <addr>` once ready.

### Configuration reference

| Variable                  | Required | Default          | Meaning |
|---------------------------|:--------:|------------------|---------|
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL`    | yes      | —                | durable-streams base URL. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL`    | yes¹     | —                | Postgres connection string. Setting it enables Postgres mode. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES` | yes¹     | (empty)          | Comma-separated tables to watch: `schema.name`, a bare `name` (= `public.<name>`), or `schema.*` / `*` for every table with a primary key in that schema. `*` and an empty setting both mean `public.*` — never every schema. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_SLOT`   | no       | `electric_circuits`  | Logical replication slot name (unique per engine). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_POLL_MS`| no       | —                | Legacy; accepted but unused (the ingestor streams pgoutput, push delivery). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_BIND`      | no       | `127.0.0.1:0`    | Address for the control/HTTP API. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_LOG`       | no       | `info`           | Log filter (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`). |

¹ Omit `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL` to run in library/no-source mode (shapes start empty; used by tests).

## Step 3 — Connect the client

The client subscribes to shapes over the engine's API and materializes them with TanStack DB.
Writes go to **Postgres**, not the client:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@electric-circuits/client'

const client = createClient({ apiUrl: 'http://engine.internal:9000', schema })

// Declare a shape; rows stay live as Postgres changes.
const activeUsers = await client.shape({
  table: 'users',
  where: { col: 'active', op: 'eq', value: true },
})

activeUsers.subscribe((rows) => render(rows))

// To change data, write to Postgres however you already do (psql, your ORM, etc.):
//   UPDATE users SET active = false WHERE id = 42;
// electric-circuits picks it up via logical replication and updates the shape.
```

## Operating notes

- **Adding a table:** add it to `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES` and restart the engine. It will introspect
  and set replica identity on the new table at startup.
- **Replication slot lag:** an engine that is stopped for a long time holds its slot, and Postgres
  retains WAL for it. If you decommission an engine, drop its slot:
  `SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('<slot>');` Monitor `pg_replication_slots.confirmed_flush_lsn` vs
  `pg_current_wal_lsn()` to watch lag.
- **Consistency:** on shape registration the engine takes a `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot of the
  matching rows (the backfill) and, atomically with it, captures the snapshot's
  `pg_current_snapshot()` — the **snapshot gate**. Each replicated change is stamped with its
  transaction's **commit LSN, xid, and in-transaction position**, and the engine skips a change iff
  its xid was **visible to the backfill snapshot** (already in the seed); everything else is taken
  from the live stream. Visibility — not WAL position — is the fence because a commit's WAL record
  exists before the transaction becomes snapshot-visible; an LSN-only comparison would drop rows in
  that window. Ingest delivery is at-least-once (append, then advance the slot), and the engine
  de-duplicates by `(commit LSN, position)`, so each change takes effect exactly once. This assumes a
  single ingestor per database (the model above). Running multiple ingestors over the same tables is
  not supported.
- **Degraded forms are loud:** if a table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` is reset from `FULL` (e.g. a migration
  recreated it), updates lose their old image and deletes their tuple — the engine logs errors and
  tells you to restore identity + recreate shapes. `TRUNCATE` is not propagated (also logged);
  recreate shapes after one.
- **Permissions:** the engine's Postgres role needs `SELECT` on the watched tables, ownership (for
  `ALTER TABLE … REPLICA IDENTITY`), and the `REPLICATION` attribute (to create/read the slot).
- **Introspection surface:** the engine's control port also serves the pipeline-visualizer backend —
  `/trace` (per-envelope SSE), `/graph`, `/state`, and the `/state/node` deep dumps, which expose row
  data. These endpoints are **unauthenticated**; anyone who can reach the control port can read them.
  The runtime cost is near zero while nobody subscribes (instrumentation is gated on subscriber
  count), so leaving them on is fine when the port is private. If the control port is reachable
  beyond your trust boundary, either front it with network policy or disable the surface outright
  with `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_TRACE=0` (the routes are then never registered).
