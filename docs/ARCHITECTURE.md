```

Three ideas carry the whole design:

1. **Postgres is the system of record; the engine holds no copy of any table.** The engine keeps
   per-shape routing metadata and shared subquery inner-sets only; shape backfills and membership
   query-backs read just the matching rows from Postgres (pooled, parallel). The circuit's counts
   pipelines (§6b) are *derived*, in-memory, reseed-on-boot state — never the record of truth.
2. **Everything between layers is an append-only stream.** The write path (replication → table
   streams) and the read path (shape streams → clients) never talk directly; the engine is a
   restartable consumer in the middle.
3. **Every maintained result is de-duplicated.** Two equal shapes — same table, canonical predicate,
   projection, and kind — share one maintained stream, ref-counted. Identical subqueries share one
   inner-set node. Identical aggregations share one running fold. The engine maintains and appends
   once for all subscribers.

---

## 1. Components

- **durable-streams** — append-only, offset-addressed JSON streams with long-poll tailing. One
  `changes` stream for all tables (the write log; the envelope's `type` carries the table's
  canonical `schema.name` — always qualified, see ADR-0002),
  one `shape/<id>` stream per distinct shape (the
  result feed). The decoupling boundary between write and read paths.
- **engine** (`apps/engine`, Rust) — the core: replication ingest, per-change Z-set deltas, fan-out to
  shapes/subqueries/aggregations, the control-plane HTTP API, and the Electric-compatible
  `GET /v1/shape` endpoint.
- **API** (`apps/api`, tRPC) — the extended surface used by `@electric-circuits/client`: `schema.define`,
  `ingest.write` (library mode), `shapes.create/get/delete`, `subset.query/live`, `aggregate`.
- **client** (`packages/client`) — `shape()` (a live TanStack DB collection), `subset()` (an ordered,
  windowed page + a shared live tail), `aggregate()` (a live scalar), typed writes, `awaitTxId`.
- **oracle + conformance** (`packages/oracle`, `packages/conformance`) — a Postgres/pglite reference
  implementation and the harness asserting engine ≡ oracle for the same op stream, through the real
  API + client, including live replication, fuzzing, NULLs, and concurrent writers.

---

## 2. Data model

- **`Value`** (`value.rs`) — `Int | Float | Text | Bool | Null`. NULL is first-class (three-valued
  logic). **`Row`** = positional `Vec<Value>`; the schema names the positions.
- **Z-set delta** — `Vec<Tup2<Row, ZWeight>>`, `ZWeight` a signed i64: insert = `(row,+1)`, delete =
  `(old,−1)`, update = `(old,−1),(new,+1)`. `old` comes from the replication envelope
  (`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`), so no local table state is needed to retract a row. The delta algebra
  is [`dbsp`](https://crates.io/crates/dbsp)'s — `Tup2` and `ZWeight` are dbsp's own, and
  `Value`/`Row` carry the `DBData` derive stack. Routing- and fallback-tier shapes are evaluated
  by plain Rust (key routing + stateless predicate evaluation; internals doc §1); the circuit
  tier (§6b) maintains the counts pipelines and the membership circuit's contributor relation,
  serving decomposable COUNT aggregates and the subquery registry's inner-set state (the
  per-feed delete gate lives host-side, `subq_feed.rs`). Row arrangements no longer exist —
  row data lives in Postgres.
- **Envelope** (`ds.rs`) — the unit on every stream:
  `{ type, key, value, old, headers{ operation, txid, offset, lsn, seq } }`. The ingestor stamps
  `lsn` (transaction **commit** LSN), `txid` (the Postgres **xid**), and `seq` (the change's position
  within its transaction).

---

## 3. Ingest: logical replication, exactly-once effect

`replication.rs` **streams** a `pgoutput` slot over the walsender protocol (push delivery — no
poll floor; the wire client is `pgwire-replication`, the message decoding is our `pgoutput.rs`).
Each transaction's changes are buffered between `Begin` and `Commit`, stamped with
`(commit LSN, xid, seq)`, appended to `changes`, and only **then** acknowledged to Postgres
(`confirmed_flush_lsn`) — a failed append tears the connection down unacknowledged, and the server
resends from the confirmed position.

Delivery to the table streams is therefore **at-least-once** (a partial multi-table append failure,
or acknowledgements not yet flushed at a crash, re-deliver whole transactions). Deltas are *not*
idempotent for aggregates and subquery contributor weights, so the consumer side restores
exactly-once **effect**:

- **Sequencer de-duplication.** `(commit LSN, seq)` uniquely identifies a change and is strictly
  increasing on the single ordered log. The sequencer keeps a highwater mark and skips anything at
  or below it.
- The drain-barrier sentinel (`__el_sync`) is published only after its whole commit landed on the
  streams, so the barrier can never claim "drained" while a transaction is still due for re-append.

Degraded/unsupported forms are **loud, never silent**: an `UPDATE` without an old image or a `DELETE`
without tuple data (REPLICA IDENTITY no longer FULL) and `TRUNCATE` log errors describing the staleness
they cause; unparseable values (e.g. `NaN` floats) log errors when degraded to NULL.

---

## 4. Backfill and the consistency fence (SnapshotGate)

A shape's initial rows come from a single `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot with the predicate pushed into
the `SELECT`. Live and backfill must then be reconciled so every change counts exactly once.

**LSN comparison alone is not sound.** `pg_current_wal_lsn()` is a WAL *write* position, but snapshot
visibility is decided later, at `ProcArrayEndTransaction` (after the commit record is fsynced). A
transaction whose commit record is already in the WAL can be **invisible** to a snapshot taken during
that window — skipping its replicated change "because commit LSN < seed LSN" would drop the row from
both the backfill and the live stream, permanently. Conversely, a visible commit can sit exactly at
the boundary and be replayed as a duplicate.

The fence is therefore **transaction visibility** (`pg::SnapshotGate`): the backfill transaction
captures `pg_current_snapshot()` (xmin / xmax / in-progress xids) in the same statement that
establishes the snapshot, and the engine skips a replicated change **iff its xid was visible to that
snapshot** (every xid seen on the slot is committed, so visibility is `xid < xmin`, or
`xmin ≤ xid < xmax` and not in the in-progress list). Changes without a parseable xid (library mode)
fall back to the strict-`<` LSN comparison. Every seeded structure — routed shapes, standalone shapes,
aggregations, subquery nodes, subquery shapes — carries its own gate; `changes_only` feeds carry a
passthrough gate (no backfill ⇒ forward everything).

The backfill row representation is normalized to match the live path: text-mapped columns are read
with `::text` casts so a cell's value is Postgres's *text output* — the same form pgoutput's
text-mode tuples
prints — rather than `to_jsonb`'s (which would make the same timestamp compare unequal between a
backfilled row and its first live update).

*Known residual:* the **client-side subset seam** (§7) still positions by LSN watermarks; the same
visibility window theoretically applies to a subset page's snapshot vs its live tail and would need
the page query-back to also return the snapshot's xid list. Engine-maintained state is fully fenced.

---

## 5. The engine: fan-out, sharing, lifecycle

### 5.1 Sequencer model

ONE tokio task consumes the single ordered change log for all tables — Electric's
`ShapeLogCollector` pattern. Processing is serial in commit order (global ordering and state are
trivially correct), and each source transaction's shape appends are flushed **before the next
transaction is processed** — per-transaction atomic emission, across tables; the only intra-txn
parallelism is the append flush (bounded-concurrent, CAP=32). After a batch is fully fanned out
**and every append has landed**, the sequencer publishes its processed offset — the convergence
barrier used by the conformance harness (`GET /tables/<t>/offset` reports the global offset).

Shape creation is **two-phase** so a Postgres backfill never stalls the pipeline: `BeginShape`
registers a pending shape that buffers its table's deltas; the creator runs the backfill on a
pooled connection concurrently; `ActivateShape` replays the buffer through the shape's snapshot
gate and goes live. The buffer is registered before the snapshot is taken, so no change can fall
between them.

### 5.2 Three execution strategies

The shape of the predicate picks the strategy (full detail + cost model: internals doc §3):

- **Equality templates** (`a = 1 AND b = 2`) → **key routing**: one shared `KeyRouter` per key-column
  set; `key_tuple → {shapes}`. Routing is O(log N), independent of shape count; zero table rows held.
- **Standalone** (ranges, OR, NOT, …) → a stateless three-valued filter evaluated directly on the
  delta. No state. A necessary-conjunct index (`(column, op)` — equality hash buckets + ordered
  range bounds) selects only the candidate shapes per change; predicates with no indexable
  conjunct (OR/NOT/LIKE/`!=` at the top) fall back to a scan list.
- **Subqueries** (`col [NOT] IN (SELECT …)`) → the cross-table registry (§6), for every
  subquery form — the registry is the one membership implementation (row data lives in
  Postgres; see §6b).

**Aggregations** (electric-circuits extension, not part of the Electric-compatible API): a scalar
COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX over a non-subquery predicate, maintained incrementally as a fold over the
delta — COUNT/SUM/AVG hold running scalars, MIN/MAX a `value → net-weight` multiset so retractions
restore the previous extreme. A COUNT whose predicate decomposes over a counts pipeline's group
columns is served from the circuit instead (§6b). SQL NULL semantics are mirrored exactly: aggregates ignore NULL values,
`COUNT(col)` counts non-NULLs (`COUNT(*)` counts rows), AVG divides by the non-NULL count, and
SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX over zero non-NULL values are NULL. The feed carries the current value as a
single-row stream (`{ value, n }`).

### 5.3 Shape de-duplication (the sharing layer)

Any two **equal** shapes share one maintained stream, ref-counted:

- **Signature.** Row shapes: `(table, canonical predicate, sorted projection, changes_only)` —
  predicate canonicalization is order-insensitive (`a AND b` ≡ `b AND a`). Aggregations:
  `(table, canonical predicate, function, column)`, namespaced so the two kinds never collide.
- **Join.** A create whose signature already exists increments the refcount and returns the *same*
  shape id + stream. Joiners **wait for the creator's backfill to land** (a watch channel in the
  share entry) so no caller ever sees a stream whose snapshot isn't readable yet — and a *failed*
  creation propagates to every waiting joiner rather than handing them a dead stream.
- **Drop.** Deletes decrement; the shape, its routing/registry entries, **and its durable stream**
  are torn down when the last subscriber leaves (a dropped shape must not leave an orphaned stream
  on the storage server). N joiners hold the same id and must each delete exactly once; the client
  enforces one-shot `close()`.
- The Electric `/v1/shape` adapter opts out (`share=false`) — its protocol needs per-request handles.

### 5.4 Creation is atomic; failures never leave zombies

`create_shape` returns `Ok` only after registration + backfill actually succeeded. On any failure —
backfill error, subquery seeding error, append error — the shape record, share entries, sequencer
registration, and (for subqueries) every node refcount/edge/pending-seed added by the attempt are
rolled back, waiting joiners get the error, and the stream is deleted. This structurally excludes
the "zombie shape" failure mode: a shape that is registered, streams nothing, and pins its
signature so all future identical creates silently join a dead feed.

### 5.5 Reliability: appends never drop silently

A lost shape-stream append is a permanent divergence for every subscriber, so live-path appends use
`append_reliable`: transient failures retry with capped backoff (backpressuring the sequencer — the same
stance as the ingestor's read-then-commit), and the only non-retried case is a **retired** stream —
404 (deleted), 410 (soft-deleted) or 409 + `stream-closed` (retirement closes the stream before
deleting it, §5.6) — i.e. the shape was dropped/evicted mid-flush; discard is correct. Because
shape envelopes are absolute per-pk (`upsert`/`delete` by key), an ambiguous-failure double-append
is idempotent for readers.

### 5.6 Retirement closes the stream before deleting it

When the engine removes a shape stream of its own accord — purge, eviction, drop-at-restore, the
degraded subquery reap — it **retires** it (`ds.retire_stream`): first a close (`POST` with
`Stream-Closed: true`), then the delete. The close releases every waiting long-poll immediately with
`stream-closed` instead of leaving it parked until the 30 s read timeout, and "closed" unambiguously
means *the engine retired this shape; re-subscribe*. Clients **must** treat `stream-closed`, 404 and
410 alike; on the `/v1/shape` adapter the engine does that for them (a closed stream ends the live
poll with `409 must-refetch`, the evicted-handle answer). Closing is terminal, so it is applied only
to retirement: a **dormant** shape's retained
stream stays appendable for reactivation, a rolled-back create's stream was never handed to a
subscriber, and a restart keeps restored shapes on their existing streams
(`docs/adr/0007-retirement-closes-before-delete.md`).

---

## 6. Subqueries: shared inner-set nodes

(Cost model: internals doc §3.3.)

A predicate leaf `col [NOT] IN (SELECT proj FROM inner WHERE …)` routes through a registry the
sequencer feeds every table's deltas into:

- **Node** — one per distinct inner query (canonical signature), ref-counted. The node's value
  set lives in the **membership circuit** (§6b): the registry asserts each inner row's current
  contribution *absolutely* (`(node_id, pk) → value` / absent) into a dbsp **upsert map**, which
  derives the exact retract/insert deltas internally — there is no host-side reverse index to
  keep in sync. A value is in the set iff its contributor count is positive. (Assertions are
  computed host-side because evaluation can read *other* nodes' sets via nested `IN`.)
- **Templates** — nodes are grouped by parameterized template (`predicate.rs::subquery_template`):
  the inner WHERE's top-level equality literals are lifted out as a **bind**, so `user_id = 1` and
  `user_id = 2` share one compiled residual + parameter projection. A delta on the inner table is
  evaluated **once per template** (one residual eval + one bind hash-lookup per touched pk),
  routed to the single affected node — instead of one full-predicate eval per literal-keyed node.
  Flip detection is the circuit's incremental distinct: the step's output deltas ARE the flips.
- **Edges** — `node → dependent` (an outer shape, or a *parent node* for nested subqueries), labeled
  with the connecting column. When a node **flips** a value (∅→non-empty or back), the dependent rows
  with `connecting_col = value` are queried back and re-evaluated, recursing up the DAG. Flip
  propagation runs on a **semaphore-bounded worker pool** (`ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FLIP_WORKERS`, default 8),
  off the sequencer hot path: the Postgres query-backs run concurrently (bounded by the shared
  `ELECTRIC_DB_POOL_SIZE` pool) and never hold the registry lock. Membership evaluation and the
  **enqueue** of the resulting envelopes happen atomically under the lock, and each shape stream
  drains through one ordered **emission lane** (`engine/emission.rs`, `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_EMIT_LANES`),
  so per-shape append order equals evaluation order — without network under the lock. (Evaluation
  order alone is not freshness for a query-back, whose rows were read before it took the lock; the
  per-pk recency fence below closes that gap.) The engine exposes the in-flight count
  (`GET /replication/lsn` → `pendingFlips`) as the extra convergence-barrier term; it covers both
  undrained flips and enqueued-but-unlanded lane batches. A failed query-back is **retried**, and
  the retry resumes the DAG walk where the failure stopped (the walk consumes transitions, so
  restarting it from the roots would derive nothing and silently lose the dependents' moves). If
  the retries are exhausted the batch's effects are gone for good — the node already moved — so
  the engine **fails closed**: the batch never decrements `pendingFlips` (the barrier can only
  reach zero when every computed effect really landed), `flipFailures` counts it, `/v1/health`
  turns `degraded` (503), every membership-bearing route answers 503, and every subquery shape's
  durable stream is retired — closed, then deleted (§5.6) — so clients reading storage directly
  learn it too: a tailing read is released with `stream-closed` and must re-subscribe. Recovery is a
  **restart**, which re-seeds every node from Postgres; it *drops* every subquery shape (their
  inner-node state is not persisted — see the restart row of the durability table) and clients
  recreate them with `POST /shapes`.
- **Absolute emission via the per-feed key set** — the correctness rule that keeps deferred
  flips convergent: for each touched pk the registry asserts the row's *current* membership into
  the shape's **feed set** (`subq_feed::FeedSet`, one host-side Roaring bitmap per feed), never a
  history-dependent delta. An `upsert` is delivered for every matching candidate (updates to
  continuing members flow); a `delete` is delivered **only when the check-and-set actually removes**,
  so a "not a member" verdict for a pk the stream never contained is structurally a no-op — the
  never-member spurious delete (the PR #30 wake-storm) cannot be emitted at all. Flip
  propagation runs deferred (out of commit order); absolute assertion converges regardless of
  that timing — which is why the Electric-style LSN-buffering/tag protocol isn't needed here.
- **Query-back recency** — absolute assertion makes cross-pk ordering irrelevant, but the *last*
  evaluation of a given pk still has to be the freshest one. A query-back reads its candidates at
  one Postgres snapshot with the registry lock released, so a direct outer-row change committed
  after that snapshot can be evaluated and emitted in between — and the query-back's older row
  would then be the stream's last word for that pk (consumers fold by durable-stream offset, so an
  older LSN on the envelope would not repair it). While a shape has a query-back in flight it
  therefore records, per pk, the commit stamp of the live decision it applied — including
  decisions that emitted nothing, which is the case a stale query-back would otherwise silently
  undo. Each query-back drops the candidates whose recorded stamp is **not visible to its own read
  snapshot** (`SnapshotGate` xid visibility, the same fence a backfill uses — not an LSN compare):
  that decision is newer than the row in hand, so it stands. The map is bounded by the in-flight
  window and cleared when the last query-back for the shape finishes. The same fence applies to a
  parent **node**'s re-derivation, which reads its inner rows the same way: it appends nothing
  itself, but its dependent shape appends what its flips say, so a re-asserted stale contribution
  is the same permanent divergence one level down.
- **NULL sensitivity** — SQL: a NULL in the inner set makes `x NOT IN S` UNKNOWN. A NULL flip
  re-derives exactly the dependents that can change: those whose `IN` leaf is negated **or sits under
  any `Not{…}`** (with no negation above the leaf, NULL only moves the leaf between FALSE and
  UNKNOWN, and AND/OR are monotone over FALSE < UNKNOWN < TRUE, so inclusion can't change).
- **Atomicity** — node creation/refcounts/edges roll back exactly on a failed shape create (§5.4).
- **The creation window** — a subquery create registers its edges before it backfills, so a flip on
  an inner node it *shares* with an already-live shape reaches it while there is no shape to move
  yet. Such work is **queued on the pending create** and replayed once the shape is installed (both
  in one registry step, so a flip either queues or finds the shape), which is what keeps an inner
  change committed after the backfill's snapshot from being lost for the new shape. The same holds
  one tier down: a flip reaching a *parent node* the create is still seeding is **queued on that
  node** (its set is empty until the seed lands, and the seed — from an older snapshot — would be
  installed over the change), then re-derived and walked on down the DAG at install.
- **Phase-C ownership** — the create's rollback state (compile log, buffers, fresh nodes) stays in
  the registry across every await of the install, so a client disconnect anywhere in phase C —
  including after some node seeds have reached the membership circuit — leaves a pending entry the
  detached rollback unwinds exactly, retracting the partial seed with it.

---

## 6b. The circuit tier: counts pipelines + the membership circuit

The circuit tier is two small dbsp circuits per engine (O(1) — never per shape). **Row data
lives in Postgres, never engine-side.** The counts circuit is fully in-memory; the membership
circuit's contributor relation spills to disk by default (a disposable per-boot cache — see its
bullet). Neither circuit checkpoints: both reseed on boot.

- The **counts circuit** (`arrangements.rs`) maintains the configured counts pipelines
  ((group → count) relations, O(distinct groups)). The sequencer feeds each transaction into it
  and steps it **before** fanning the transaction out, so circuit-served aggregates emit within
  the transaction that changed them.
- The **membership circuit** (`subq_circuit.rs`, owned by the subquery registry, always on)
  holds the CONTRIBUTORS **upsert map** (dbsp `add_input_map`; the operator maintains the map
  and derives exact deltas from absolute assertions): `(node_id, pk_id) → value`, projected to
  `(node_id, value)` weighted by contributor count → `integrate_trace` snapshot (serves
  `contains`/`has_null`/introspection) + `distinct → output` (the step's deltas are the
  membership **flips**, §6). The per-feed key sets — the delete gate — live **host-side**
  (`subq_feed.rs`, one Roaring bitmap per feed over `u32` pk-dictionary ids): a synchronous
  check-and-set under the registry lock, dramatically lighter than the former in-circuit feed
  relation (§6). The registry evaluates templates host-side per envelope, under its lock, and
  awaits the step — intra-transaction ordering is identical to the old in-registry kernel, and
  reads are read-your-writes. Structure is fixed at construction (one generic input);
  registering templates/nodes/binds is pure runtime data — no rebuild, ever. State is
  O(contributing inner rows), bind-gated: only subscribed binds hold state, each seeded from
  Postgres like any backfill. The contributor relation **spills to disk by default** (dbsp's
  storage backend: spine batches page to layer files under a per-boot temp dir with a bounded
  buffer cache; without checkpointing the files are a disposable cache, auto-removed at
  shutdown). `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE=0` keeps it fully in-memory;
  `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE_DIR` pins an explicit location.

- **Counts pipelines** — `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_COUNTS=table:col+col,…` compiles, per table (at
  most one spec each), a `map_index(group) → weighted_count` pipeline: a live COUNT per
  distinct projection of the group columns.
- **Serving**: COUNT aggregates whose predicate decomposes over a counts pipeline's group
  columns (a conjunction of equalities / IN-lists over group columns only) are seeded by
  summing the matching groups and updated live from each step's group deltas. SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX —
  and COUNTs that don't decompose — use the sequencer's conjunct-indexed incremental fold (§5.2).
- **Boot**: state is in-memory only, so each counts pipeline reseeds on every boot from ONE
  `SELECT <group cols>, count(*) … GROUP BY` per table under a `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot —
  O(groups), not O(rows) — and the seed's `SnapshotGate` (xid visibility) fences change-log
  replay exactly like a shape backfill.
- **Row lookups** (subquery flip re-derivations, full re-derives, membership move-ins) are
  pooled Postgres queries (`engine/membership.rs`) — parallel across the flip-worker pool,
  bounded by `ELECTRIC_DB_POOL_SIZE`. `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_INDEXES` is **deprecated** and ignored
  (it configured the removed row arrangements).
- **Membership shapes** — including single-level non-negated `col IN (SELECT …)` — are served
  by the subquery registry (§6): two-phase creation (Postgres backfill + gate), shared inner-set
  nodes, flips, absolute emission. There is no separate cohort/arrangement membership tier; its
  reason to exist (local row snapshots) went away with the row arrangements.

### Configuration reference

| variable | default | meaning |

| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_EMIT_LANES` | `8` | ordered emission lanes for subquery-shape appends. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE` | `1` | `0` disables membership-circuit disk spilling (relations stay fully in-memory). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE_DIR` | per-boot temp dir | explicit spill location (kept on shutdown; the default temp dir is auto-removed). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE_CACHE_MIB` | `64` | storage buffer-cache budget, in MiB, TOTAL (dbsp uses the value verbatim, not multiplied by workers/thread-types). Bounds dbsp's own unset-default, which for this circuit's 1-worker layout would be 512 MiB (256 MiB × 1 worker × 2 thread-types). |

(The former `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_DIR`/`_CACHE_MIB`/`_MIN_STORAGE_KB`/`_MAX_RSS_MB`/
`_CHECKPOINT_SECS`/`_INDEXES` storage knobs are deprecated no-ops: there is no on-disk circuit
state to tune. `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FEED_TRACE` is likewise removed — the feed relation now lives
host-side (Phase 2), so there is no enumeration copy left to toggle.)

- **Observability**: `/graph` carries an `arrangements` section — the counts pipelines as
  stable-id nodes (`arr:input:<table>`, `arr:counts:<table>`, with seeded flags) plus a
  `consumers` list connecting each counts node to the circuit-served aggregates it feeds.
- **Limits**: a dbsp circuit's structure is fixed at construction, so new **counts specs**
  need a restart (state reseeds from Postgres in O(groups), so a restart is cheap); single
  worker; COUNT only. Subquery templates are NOT structure — the membership circuit's one
  tuple input serves any number of them, registered at runtime.

### The serving model this is one tier of

- **The circuit serves count templates.** Deploy-time counts pipelines, one live count per
  cohort group, never growing with shapes/users/parameter combinations. A COUNT aggregate is a
  selection/sum over those groups.
- **Routing serves query instances.** Equality templates share `KeyRouter` families; standalone
  predicates and aggregates are conjunct-indexed — a change finds its shapes by index lookup,
  never by scan.
- **The registry serves subqueries.** All `[NOT] IN (SELECT …)` shapes: shared inner-set
  nodes grouped as parameterized templates, membership state + flip detection in the
  membership circuit, parallel flip query-backs to Postgres, ordered emission lanes, absolute
  per-pk emission.

## 7. Subset queries and client positioning

A **subset query** is the non-materialized counterpart to a shape: one
`SELECT … WHERE … ORDER BY … LIMIT/OFFSET` page against Postgres (subquery predicates evaluated
natively by Postgres) + a **shared** `changes_only` live feed for the base predicate. Ranges live
*only* here — they are never live-tailed, so a change is matched against one base predicate, never
split across ranges. `orderBy`/`limit` are subset knobs, not shape knobs.

The client (`packages/client/src/subset.ts`) merges the page(s) and the live tail by **per-pk LSN
watermarks**: the page's snapshot LSN, and each applied delta's commit LSN. Engine output envelopes
carry their commit LSN for exactly this. Key invariants (all regression-tested):

- The feed is created and its head offset captured **before** the page snapshot, so no delta can fall
  in the gap; overlap reconciles idempotently by pk (`delta lsn ≥ snapshot lsn` applies; the engine's
  backfill-visible side is strictly below).
- **Deletes leave tombstone watermarks** (including for pks never seen): a `loadMore` page whose
  snapshot predates a delete must not resurrect the row / insert a ghost. Tombstones prune when no
  page is in flight.
- Close is one-shot; the feed is deleted with retries; a failed page query-back deletes the
  just-created feed before rethrowing (no refcount pinning).

## 8. Electric protocol adapter

`GET /v1/shape` (`electric.rs`) serves the ElectricSQL client protocol directly from the engine:
`table` + SQL `where` (+ `columns`) are parsed (`where_sql.rs`) into the same predicate AST used
everywhere else, identical `/v1/shape` definitions share ONE engine shape (`share=true`, so the
handle is the shared shape id), the shape stream is folded into the Electric message shape
(insert/update/delete + `up-to-date` control messages), and live requests long-poll. Handle state
is evicted after an idle TTL (`ELECTRIC_HANDLE_TTL`); the backing shape + stream are **retained**
and follow the engine's three-tier retention lifecycle (active / dormant / evicted — idle shapes
drop their engine state but keep the stream, and any touch reactivates them by change-log replay
from the captured resume offset (through the sequencer's two-phase pending-buffer handshake);
eviction **retires** the stream: closed, then deleted (§5.6), so a client tailing it is released
with `stream-closed` and must re-subscribe; see `apps/engine/src/retention.rs`). A request with an
evicted handle gets `409 must-refetch`,
which the Electric client handles by re-syncing onto the retained shape. Conformance against Electric's own oracle + integration tests lives in
`electric-conformance/` (see its README for scope and known gaps — e.g. row `tags` are not emitted;
absolute membership emission makes them unnecessary for convergence).

## 9. Consistency & durability model (summary)

| seam | mechanism | guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| backfill ↔ live | `SnapshotGate` (xid visibility; LSN fallback) | each change counts exactly once per shape/aggregate/node |
| ingestor → change log | append → acknowledge + `(lsn,seq)` sequencer de-dup | at-least-once delivery, exactly-once effect |
| engine → shape streams | `append_reliable` + offset published only after landing | no silently-lost deltas; barrier implies subscriber streams reflect the batch |
| cross-table subquery order | absolute membership emission + flip query-backs | convergence independent of deferred-flip timing |
| shared shapes | signature + refcount + ready-watch + atomic rollback | joiners see a live, backfilled stream or an error; last drop tears everything down |
| subset page ↔ live tail | per-pk LSN watermarks + delete tombstones | no double-count, no resurrections/ghosts across the seam (LSN-based; see §4 residual) |
| client lifecycle | one-shot close, delete-with-retry | balanced create/drop; no refcount pinning or steal |
| engine restart | durable shape catalog (`meta/catalog`: create/join/leave/drop + change-log offset checkpoints) | plain/routed shapes + aggregates restore without client re-registration (plain resume via replay + passthrough gates; aggregates re-seed with a fresh gate); counts pipelines reseed from a fresh group-aggregated snapshot (§6b); subquery shapes are dropped loudly (inner-node state is not persisted) and recreated by clients |

The invariant the conformance suite asserts end-to-end: *for any shape and any op stream, the
client-materialized set equals the oracle's `SELECT … WHERE <predicate>`* — through the real API,
stream, and client, including live replication, batched mutations, NULLs, and concurrent writers.

## 10. Threading model

| unit | threads | notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| engine main | tokio multi-thread | sequencer + flush run here |
| sequencer (all tables) | 1 task | commit-ordered change processing; per-txn atomic flush |
| shapes (any kind) | **0** | no per-shape thread or circuit |
| replication ingestor | 1 task | stream pgoutput/decode/append/acknowledge |
| subquery registry | 0 (a mutex) | eval + emission-lane enqueue under it (in-memory only; no network under the lock) |
| flip workers | ≤ `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FLIP_WORKERS` tasks (default 8) | concurrent deferred query-backs; PG round-trips never hold the registry lock |
| emission lanes | `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_EMIT_LANES` tasks (default 8) | per-stream FIFO writers: append order = eval order per shape |
| circuit (counts) | 1 OS thread | owns the `DBSPHandle`; blocking steps, fed by a bounded channel (backpressure to the sequencer) |
| circuit (membership) | 1 OS thread | owns the membership `DBSPHandle`; stepped per envelope by the registry (subquery tables only) |

Threads are flat in the number of shapes *and* in the number of equality templates.

---

## 11. Telemetry

- `GET /metrics` — atomic counters (`envelopes_processed`, `shape_appends`, `family_steps`) +
  log-bucket latency histograms (`process_envelope`, `family_step`, `append`) with p50/p99/p999/max.
- `GET /memory` + OTel gauges (`engine_shapes`, `engine_subquery_nodes`, `engine_subquery_contributors`,
  `engine_family_circuits`, …) — the cardinalities that drive RSS; `GET /metrics/prometheus` exports.
- `GET /graph`, `GET /graph/node?sig=…`, `GET /shapes/{id}/rows` — the live pipeline topology + node
  indexes + shape contents, consumed by the **pipeline explorer** (`apps/pipeline-viz`).
- `GET /state`, `GET /state/node?id=…` — per-node live state: summaries for every pipeline node
  (offsets, emit counters, routing-index/inner-set cardinalities, fold values) and on-demand deep
  dumps (a family's routing index contents, an aggregate's fold internals incl. the MIN/MAX
  multiset). Summaries are also pushed as `{"type":"state"}` events on `/trace` after each batch,
  which is what makes the explorer's node chips reactive without polling.
- `GET /tables/<t>/families`, `GET /subqueries` — sharing topology (proof that N shapes share one
  router/node).

## 12. Potential speedups

The engine's internal per-change cost stays small even at a large shape count; the end-to-end
ceiling under load is **storage throughput** (the single-process durable-streams test server), not
engine compute.

**Storage / append path (current ceiling)**
1. Multi-stream append (one request, many streams) — fan-out to M streams is M HTTP requests today.
2. HTTP/2 multiplexing / persistent pipelined connections to storage.
3. Shard the sequencer's fan-out (partition a table's shapes/key-space across tasks). (Subquery
   flip propagation is already parallel: worker pool + ordered emission lanes.)
4. ~~A production durable-streams backend (the old Node test server fsynced per append).~~ Done:
   the streams layer is the Rust `durable-streams` server (group-commit WAL; `packages/ds-rust`
   wrapper).

**Standalone evaluation (O(K) per change)**
5. ~~Predicate indexing by `(column, op)` — turn O(K) into output-sensitive.~~ Done: standalone
   shapes are indexed by a necessary conjunct (equality → hash bucket, range bound → ordered
   scan); only candidates are evaluated per change. Un-indexable predicates (OR/NOT/LIKE/`!=`)
   remain on a fallback scan list.
6. Widen the shared class beyond pure equality (e.g. single-column range templates).

**Engine compute / representation**
7. ~~Backfill connection pooling for burst shape creation (the fleet benchmark's p99 driver).~~
   Done: backfills/query-backs/subset queries share a per-URL pool (`ELECTRIC_DB_POOL_SIZE`, default 20).
8. Intern stream paths/txids; pack `Value` (smaller enum, interned strings).

---

## 13. Client query layer (two-level querying)

There are **two query layers** with different jobs:

1. **Server-side shape predicate** — *what crosses the network*. One table + a `WHERE` over its
   columns (+ subqueries), optionally narrowed by a `columns` projection (sync only what a view
   needs; the pk is always included). The engine maintains exactly this set on the shape stream.
2. **Client-side live query** (TanStack DB `useLiveQuery` over the materialized collection) — *how
   it's presented*: ordering, text search, finer filtering. Maintained incrementally on the client;
   a refinement (typing in a search box) never touches the engine or re-syncs.

**Windowed / infinite-scroll sync** uses **subset queries** (§7): each page is a bounded keyset range
query (`col < lastSeen OR (col = lastSeen AND id < lastId)` folded into the `WHERE`), no stateful
top-N anywhere. The render layer is virtualized, so a 100k-row deployment stays a few dozen DOM nodes.
For permissioned/faceted lists, prefer **per-facet feeds reused across filter changes** + a client
merge (identical predicates across users ⇒ shared engine families) over folding UI filters into the
predicate (which recreates the feed per click) — see AGENTS.md "gotchas".
