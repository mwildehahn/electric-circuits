# Electric Circuits internal pilot implementation plan

**Date:** 2026-08-27  
**Status:** implementation plan for review  
**Architecture:**
[`2026-08-27-aws-durable-streams-and-engine-deployment-design.md`](./2026-08-27-aws-durable-streams-and-engine-deployment-design.md)

## 1. Outcome

Deploy Electric Circuits and a shared self-hosted Durable Streams service to the Indexed development
and production AWS accounts, then enable two independent employee-only product experiments:

1. committed `Conversation` and `Message` synchronization through Electric Circuits; and
2. provisional in-progress agent output through Durable Streams.

The incumbent Electric path remains the default and rollback path. This plan does not claim external
production readiness, zero-downtime source freshness, multi-AZ storage, or an independently deployed
ingestor.

`INTERNAL_PILOT_V1` is an operational cohort mode, not a release-qualification profile. Evidence from
the pilot can qualify later profiles, but the profile name itself must never be used as evidence that
the system is ready for general customer traffic.

## 2. Decisions closed for implementation

### 2.1 Engine and ingestor boundary

Do not deploy a separate ingestor now. The pilot runs the current coupled engine and uses the
stop-confirm-start handoff from the architecture specification. Durable Streams stays available, so
existing stream reads continue while new control operations and PostgreSQL-to-stream freshness pause.

After path and storage lineage are in place, extract a typed **in-process** transaction-source seam.
The seam must not add a process, task, slot owner, network hop, durable consumer registry, deployment
mode, or configuration switch in the pilot. Its purpose is to make a later service split mechanical
without paying the continuous-generation correctness cost now.

The first envelope contract is:

```text
InputTransactionV1 {
  version: 1,
  source_commit_id,
  txid,
  commit_lsn,
  envelopes: [EnvelopeV1 { seq, last, ... }]
}
```

Only complete transactions cross the seam; exactly one final envelope has `last=true`. N/N-1 codecs,
durable consumer leases, snapshot/change-log fences, and an independently deployed writer remain
blocked work for `CONTINUOUS_ENGINE_V1`.

### 2.2 Stack namespace and paths

The required engine scope is:

- `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_NAMESPACE`: immutable stack name;
- `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_STORE_ID`: expected storage identity;
- `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_STORE_GENERATION`: expected storage generation; and
- `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_QUERY_GENERATION`: immutable query-engine generation.

The engine also requires `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`,
`ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_LAYOUT_VERSION`, `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_DURABILITY_MODE`,
`ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_WAL_SHARDS`, `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_STREAM_LANES`, and
`ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_FILESYSTEM_UUID`. Together these expected values form `StoreIdentityV1`. No
observed storage response can supply a missing expected value.

The namespace and query generation use lowercase ASCII identifiers matching
`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,46}[a-z0-9]$` (3–48 characters). Dots, slashes, underscores, percent escapes,
whitespace, uppercase characters, and empty values are rejected. `store_generation` is a canonical
lowercase UUID. Development and production have no unqualified compatibility fallback. Unit tests may
construct an explicit test scope; no environment-sensitive `unscoped` mode is shipped.

All logical Durable Streams paths are qualified exactly once inside `DsClient`. Callers continue to
use `meta/catalog`, `changes/<segment>`, and `shape/<id>`. A path already beginning with `/`, containing
an empty component, `.` or `..`, a backslash, a query/fragment marker, or a percent escape is rejected
before HTTP I/O.

### 2.3 Storage identity authority

Pulumi creates `store_id` and `store_generation` as explicit per-environment values and stores them in
protected SSM parameters. Pulumi also records the expected volume ID, KMS key, selected AZ, filesystem
UUID, protocol/layout version, durability mode, WAL shards, and stream lanes. Those values are the
independent expected configuration; the on-volume manifest is the observed state.

A one-shot host operation initializes a new volume using the explicit expected values. Ordinary
server startup only validates. A reset allocates a new `store_generation` and uses a newly empty or
explicitly replaced filesystem; it never rewrites the identity of a live store in place. Neither the
ECS task entrypoint nor an empty stream inventory may auto-initialize a store.

The first manifest format is JSON at `/data/.durable-streams-store-v1.json`, written via temporary
file, file `fsync`, atomic rename, and parent-directory `fsync`. It contains every field named in the
architecture specification. Unknown fields are tolerated; missing required fields, duplicate keys,
type mismatches, or expected/observed mismatches are fatal.

### 2.3.1 `StoreReadinessV1` contract

`GET /_admin/ready` returns the following versioned shape. This document is the normative contract
for the first-wave implementations; a semantic change requires a new `contract_version`.

```json
{
  "contract_version": "durable-streams-store-ready-v1",
  "status": "ready",
  "artifact_digest": "sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "manifest": {
    "store_id": "2bc96d0b-9740-4f50-97c6-754b2b27d6b0",
    "store_generation": "ff8b5fa6-e786-4994-8da0-f14e9e79f318",
    "protocol_version": 1,
    "layout_version": 1,
    "durability_mode": "wal",
    "wal_shard_count": 2,
    "stream_lane_count": 1,
    "filesystem_uuid": "253f14d5-cbee-4df8-9e3c-e44c6e41501b",
    "creation_time": "2026-08-27T19:00:00Z"
  },
  "recovery": {
    "completed": true,
    "wal_shards": [
      { "shard": 0, "durable_lsn": 0, "checkpoint_lsn": 0 },
      { "shard": 1, "durable_lsn": 0, "checkpoint_lsn": 0 }
    ]
  },
  "reserve": {
    "free_bytes": 85899345920,
    "free_inodes": 1000000,
    "minimum_free_bytes": 21474836480,
    "minimum_free_inodes": 10000,
    "satisfied": true
  }
}
```

Required fields have exactly the displayed JSON types. Integer fields are non-negative and fit in
unsigned 64 bits; shard indices and the manifest counts fit in unsigned 32 bits. UUIDs are canonical
lowercase hyphenated values. `creation_time` uses the whole-second canonical RFC 3339 UTC form
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`; fractional seconds and numeric offsets are rejected so it has one spelling.
`artifact_digest` is lowercase `sha256:` plus 64 hexadecimal digits. Duplicate keys at any level are
rejected; unknown fields are tolerated. The manifest object is byte-for-field identical to the
on-volume manifest.

`status` is one of `starting`, `recovering`, `ready`, or `stopping`. It is `ready` if and only if
`recovery.completed` and `reserve.satisfied` are both true. The endpoint returns HTTP 200 only for
`ready` and HTTP 503 for the other well-formed states. It is read-only and bounded, contains no
credentials or stream inventory, and never initializes or repairs state. The per-shard LSN values are
operational WAL frontiers, not PostgreSQL lineage or a global ordering across shards.

Both first-wave repositories keep positive and negative fixtures for this exact shape, including
duplicate-key, missing-field, wrong-type, non-canonical UUID/time/digest, non-ready, and reserve-failed
cases. The engine owns the strict reader and the server owns the writer; neither may weaken the
contract independently.

### 2.4 Access boundary

The pilot access boundary is a small Rust reverse-proxy binary, `durable-streams-access`, built and
pinned alongside the Durable Streams server. Durable Streams itself remains HTTP on
`127.0.0.1:4437`; the proxy alone listens on private port 8443. The proxy:

- terminates TLS 1.3 and requires a client certificate issued by the environment AWS Private CA;
- maps the certificate URI SAN to a configured service identity;
- authorizes HTTP method plus normalized stream prefix before forwarding;
- exposes `GET /_admin/ready` only to the storage-administrator and configured pilot Circuits-engine
  identities, and exposes `/_admin/inventory` only to storage-administrator/retention identities;
- forwards streaming reads without buffering the full body and applies explicit body/time limits;
- emits structured authorization, queue, upstream, and trace logs to stdout/CloudWatch; and
- enforces per-identity concurrency and append-rate limits before reaching the server.

Certificates and private keys are delivered through Secrets Manager to the task and rotated by a
controlled task replacement. A versioned, read-only policy file is rendered by IaC; its SHA-256 is
logged at startup and included in deployment evidence. Policy parse failure, unknown identities,
ambiguous prefix matches, unnormalized paths, missing client certificates, and inability to obtain
storage reserve state all fail closed.

Agent producers do not connect directly. The authenticated Indexed API/gateway owns run assignment
and writes on the producer's behalf using the `agent-writer` service identity. The storage boundary
then enforces `agent-writer -> agent-runs/v1/<store-generation>/` and the gateway enforces the exact
assigned opaque run ID. Similarly, the client gateway resolves a public handle before using its
read-only storage identity. This avoids inventing per-run storage credentials while preserving both
application authorization and storage prefix isolation.

### 2.5 Pilot capacity reservations

`PILOT_AWS_V1` fixes the following conservative admission values for its 100 GiB volume. Changing
them creates `PILOT_AWS_V2` and requires repeat load qualification.

| Resource | Circuits/control | Agent writes | Gateway reads | Global |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Concurrent upstream requests | 64 | 32 | 128 | 232 |
| Append request rate | unthrottled inside concurrency bound | 100/s | n/a | n/a |
| Append bytes | protected by global reserve | 8 MiB/s | n/a | n/a |
| Stored-byte budget | 60 GiB operational budget | 20 GiB hard budget | n/a | 20 GiB free reserve |

Eight additional admin/readiness request slots are reserved outside the 232 data-request slots.
Agent admission stops when its registry reaches 20 GiB, when filesystem free space reaches 40 GiB,
or when free inodes reach twice the global hard reserve. Circuits mutations stop only at the global
20 GiB/free-inode reserve. Reads remain admitted under storage pressure. The qualification load test
must prove an agent flood cannot consume admin slots or prevent catalog/checkpoint traffic.

These are admission limits, not throughput claims. The performance task measures whether they fit
the selected instance/EBS profile and lowers them if necessary; it may not silently raise them.

### 2.6 Named source fence

The deployment controller creates a fence by inserting a UUID `source_commit_id` into a small
PostgreSQL `circuits_source_fence` table included in the Circuits publication. The row has no business
effect. The engine records the observed fence only after the complete source transaction has passed
the sequencer and every resulting catalog/output append is durable.

The durable catalog event is `SourceDrained { source_commit_id, commit_lsn }`. A private authenticated
engine endpoint returns the last durable receipt and answers whether a requested ID is drained. The
controller, not ECS, calls this endpoint. A handoff timeout aborts new control admission and leaves
the incumbent Electric provider selected; it never treats task exit or slot release as a drain
receipt.

## 3. Delivery graph

```text
EC-01 namespace + StoreBound ---------+----> EC-02 shutdown + source fence ----+
                                      |                                       |
DS-01 manifest + lock + readiness ----+----> DS-02 access boundary ------------+--> INFRA-01
                                                                              |
EC-03 in-process transaction seam --------------------------------------------+
                                                                              v
IDX-01 gateway/control contracts ---------> IDX-02 committed chat ------------> IDX-03 agent streams
                                  INFRA-01 ---------^               EC-02 -----^
                                                                              |
                                                                              v
                                                                     QUAL-01 --> ROLL-01
```

Only `EC-01` and `DS-01` begin immediately. They operate in different repositories and freeze the
lineage contract consumed by every later task.

## 4. Concrete tasks

### EC-01 — Qualify Durable Streams paths and bind the catalog to storage

**Repository:** `electric-circuits`  
**Owns:** `apps/engine/src/config.rs`, `apps/engine/src/ds.rs`, a new path-scope module,
`apps/engine/src/engine/catalog.rs`, engine boot wiring, and focused tests.

Implement:

- required `stack_namespace`, `query_generation`, and explicit expected `StoreIdentityV1`
  configuration: `store_id`, `store_generation`, `protocol_version`, `layout_version`,
  `durability_mode`, `wal_shard_count`, `stream_lane_count`, and `filesystem_uuid`, all strictly
  parsed from the independent per-environment deployment configuration;
- a `StreamScope` value that maps validated logical paths to the physical pilot prefix exactly once;
- treat the engine's existing `stream_url`/`streamUrl` response as an internal compatibility surface,
  not a pilot client contract: it may identify the private mTLS endpoint during EC-01, but no iOS or
  web client may receive or use it; `IDX-01` replaces it at the product boundary with an authenticated
  opaque gateway handle before either product flag can be enabled;
- Durable Streams HTTP-client configuration from explicit CA-bundle and client-certificate/key
  paths; pilot configuration requires an HTTPS storage URL, server verification, and client
  authentication, while plain HTTP exists only through explicit in-process test stores and never an
  environment fallback;
- `StoreReadinessV1` decoding and full expected/observed identity comparison: perform
  `GET /_admin/ready` as the first network operation after configuration validation and before
  constructing or starting PostgreSQL setup; a non-`ready`, malformed, unauthorized, or mismatched
  response is boot-fatal and performs no normal DS operation (`ensure`, append, read, close, or
  delete) and no PostgreSQL connection/setup;
- `StoreBound { store: StoreIdentityV1, stack_namespace, ingest_epoch: "coupled-v1",
  query_generation }`; it is catalog event zero, occurs exactly once, and no ordinary catalog event
  may precede it; missing, duplicate, conflicting, malformed, or later/reordered bindings are fatal;
- explicit first-namespace initialization: an empty physical catalog may receive `StoreBound` only
  when an operator-provided `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_INITIALIZE_NAMESPACE=1` is present; ordinary boot may
  not adopt an empty catalog; and
- mismatch errors that are typed, name expected versus observed identity, and leave both PostgreSQL
  and Durable Streams untouched.

Acceptance:

- two clients with different namespaces generate disjoint physical paths for identical logical
  operations;
- malformed scope/path input fails before the fake store records an operation;
- readiness/manifest mismatch fails before catalog ensure, catalog append, or PostgreSQL setup;
- first initialization writes `StoreBound` durably before slot creation/adoption;
- subsequent boot requires exactly one matching binding; missing, conflicting, or reordered binding
  histories fail closed; and
- existing logical-path tests continue to run using an explicit test scope.

Verify with `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, focused engine
tests, then the repository's required test command.

### DS-01 — Add store bootstrap, exclusive ownership, attested readiness, and inventory

**Repository:** `durable-streams-rust`  
**Owns:** `src/main.rs`, new `src/store_manifest.rs` and `src/data_dir_lock.rs` modules, loopback admin
handlers, `tests/cli_durability_guards.rs`, and new focused integration tests.

Implement:

- an explicit `bootstrap-store` CLI operation accepting every expected manifest field;
- atomic/fsynced creation that refuses any existing manifest, WAL, stream, segment, or cold-tier
  state and never starts a listener;
- a non-blocking exclusive advisory lock at `<data-dir>/.durable-streams.lock`
  (`/data/.durable-streams.lock` in deployment), acquired before bootstrap, manifest validation,
  store construction, WAL recovery, mutation, or listener bind and held for the process lifetime;
- required expected-identity startup arguments in WAL mode and strict comparison with the manifest;
- loopback-only `/_admin/ready` reporting `starting`, `recovering`, `ready`, or `stopping`, plus the
  manifest, canonical running `artifact_digest`, recovery result, durable frontier, free bytes/inodes,
  and reserve state; the digest is a required immutable startup value injected from the built image
  digest, not the Cargo package version;
- bounded/paginated `/_admin/inventory` with stream path, closed/deleted state, and durable byte count;
- a shutdown transition that becomes unready before draining committers and releasing the lock; and
- a reserved `/_admin/` route namespace that can never be created, read, appended, closed, or deleted
  as a user stream.

Acceptance:

- a second process against the same data directory exits non-zero before changing a byte or binding a
  port;
- killing a WAL process and restarting on the same matching manifest recovers acknowledged appends;
- wrong store ID/generation, filesystem UUID, layout, durability, shard, or lane refuses before
  recovery mutation;
- ordinary startup against a blank directory refuses; the lock inode is the sole allowed control
  artifact, and refusal creates no manifest, WAL, stream, segment, or cold-tier state;
- the lock path is derived from the supplied `--data-dir`; a second process fails before Store
  construction, WAL recovery, or public-listener bind while the first remains unchanged;
- bootstrap refuses a non-empty or previously initialized directory and survives crash-boundary
  tests around temporary write, rename, and directory fsync;
- readiness never reports ready before recovery and reserve checks complete; and
- inventory is bounded, stable under pagination, and excludes no stream the backup contract needs.

Verify with `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, and the
existing WAL simulation/recovery suites.

### DS-02 — Build and qualify the mTLS access boundary

**Depends on:** `DS-01`  
**Repository:** `durable-streams-rust`  
**Owns:** a new `durable-streams-access` binary/library, policy schema, container packaging, and proxy
integration tests. It does not change WAL/storage semantics.

Implement the contract in section 2.4, including method/prefix policy, URI normalization, certificate
identity, streaming proxy behavior, trace propagation, timeouts, admin isolation, and the fixed
capacity profile. Test every service identity against every verb and own/foreign prefix. Add overload,
slow-reader, lost-upstream-response, certificate rotation, and agent-budget isolation tests.

### EC-02 — Make pilot handoff observable and fail closed

**Depends on:** `EC-01`, `DS-01`  
**Repository:** `electric-circuits`  
**Owns:** engine admission/readiness, catalog receipt, shutdown result, source-fence observation, and
private admin endpoint.

Implement:

- a control-admission gate distinct from read health;
- `SourceDrained` only after the named complete transaction and all derived writes are durable;
- authenticated private `drainedThrough(source_commit_id)` state;
- an explicit non-zero/incomplete shutdown result when catalog drain does not complete; and
- tests that prove task exit, slot release, and checkpoint attempts are not mistaken for the durable
  source receipt.

The stop-confirm-start controller is delivered in `INFRA-01`; no pre-started candidate is added here.

### EC-03 — Extract the in-process transaction seam

**Depends on:** `EC-01`  
**Repository:** `electric-circuits`  
**Owns:** replication-to-sequencer transaction interface and compatibility tests.

Introduce `InputTransactionV1` between pgoutput decoding and the existing sequencer while preserving
the current single process, task, slot, ordering, backpressure, and acknowledgement behavior. Add
round-trip/golden tests for transaction boundaries and envelope version 1. Do not add HTTP, a service
binary, a durable input consumer, N/N-1 negotiation, or an independent deployment flag.

### INFRA-01 — Provision persistent storage and controlled deployments

**Depends on:** `DS-01`, `DS-02`, `EC-01`, `EC-02`  
**Repository:** `indexed`  
**Owns:** Pulumi components, AMI/user-data mount gate, ECS task/service definitions, service discovery,
IAM/KMS/Private CA/Secrets Manager/SSM policy, alarms, and the deployment controller.

Deliver:

- one environment-specific dedicated ECS EC2 capacity provider in the selected AZ;
- a separately owned encrypted gp3 volume with delete-on-termination disabled and no Multi-Attach;
- fail-closed host mount gate and explicit bootstrap runbook/automation;
- singleton Durable Streams service with the server and access-boundary containers;
- engine service using stop-confirm-start, source-fence polling, and rollback to the incumbent provider;
- security groups exposing only the proxy, plus exact service identities and prefix policy;
- the proxy HTTPS endpoint, CA bundle, and engine client-certificate/key mounts rendered into the
  engine task, with startup refusal for missing or unreadable TLS material;
- alarms for free bytes/inodes, lock/readiness, WAL recovery, request budgets, latency, and task/host
  replacement; and
- dev first, then production-account deployment with both product flags default-off.

Infrastructure tests must prove a task revision retains the volume, a second task cannot become ready,
a root-volume fallback cannot register, and host replacement reattaches the exact volume only after
former-host fencing.

### IDX-01 — Add gateway, handle, and agent-run control contracts

**Depends on:** `DS-02`, `EC-01`  
**Repository:** `indexed`  
**Owns:** authenticated server-side Circuits handles, agent-run registry/leases, provider feature flags,
and DS client configuration.

Implement separate flags for committed-chat sync and provisional-agent delivery. Public clients never
receive physical DS credentials or choose prefixes. The gateway binds every handle to principal,
template, stack, store generation, query generation, and physical stream; returns typed
`generation_changed`/`stream_expired`; owns agent stream assignment, producer epochs, terminal close,
24-hour retention eligibility, and server-authoritative leases; and enforces the 20 GiB agent budget.
It also owns the authenticated handle-stream metadata contract that carries ordered `SourceCommitID`
markers required for client materialization receipts. This is a client data contract, not an exported
engine lifecycle/control API.

### IDX-02 — Synchronize committed chat through Circuits into GRDB

**Depends on:** `IDX-01`, `INFRA-01` dev deployment  
**Repository:** `indexed` iOS  
**Owns:** reusable Circuits transport/provider wiring plus `Conversation` and `Message` scopes.

Factor the calendar prototype's Circuits configuration/session into a reusable service. Register
server-owned `Conversation` and `Message` scopes and write received committed changes into GRDB.
SwiftUI continues to observe GRDB; it never renders subscription state directly. Preserve one
authoritative base provider at a time and the existing optimistic-message ownership rules. The flag is
employee-only and can switch back to Electric without changing local query APIs.

Persist
`appliedTailAfter(source_commit_id, stack_namespace, store_generation, query_generation,
materialization_generation)` only in the same GRDB transaction that applies the corresponding
committed Circuits changes.

Planning guidance loaded for this task: repo router `ios-electric-grdb-sync`, Axiom
`axiom-networking`, and `docs/ios/agent-workflow.md`, `docs/ios/electric-sync-model.md`, and
`docs/ios/electric-grdb-coordination.md`. Before implementation, re-load those instructions and use
the repo's required build/test/simulator verification workflow.

### IDX-03 — Materialize provisional agent output into a disposable GRDB projection

**Depends on:** `IDX-01`, `IDX-02`, `EC-02`, and `INFRA-01` dev deployment  
**Repository:** `indexed` API and iOS  
**Owns:** authenticated agent-run stream endpoint/client, disposable local projection, and final-row
reconciliation.

The iOS client follows the gateway stream with `URLSession` using opaque offsets. In one GRDB
transaction it applies each effect, records `(run_id, producer_epoch, sequence)`, and advances the
opaque offset. `ConversationView` renders that GRDB projection, not the network stream. A final
committed `Message` replaces provisional output exactly once after its source receipt; `404`, typed
`410`, restart, duplicate delivery, late prior-epoch events, and an already-finalized row all converge
to the durable database state. The committed-chat and agent-delivery flags remain independent.

The terminal replacement transaction requires the matching persisted `appliedTailAfter` receipt;
otherwise it retains or reloads the disposable projection. Relaunch, duplicate delivery, stale
producer epoch, `404`, `410`, and final-before/after-commit cases converge through GRDB transactions,
never view state or in-memory sequence bookkeeping.

### QUAL-01 — Produce deployment and failure evidence

**Depends on:** all implementation tasks  
**Repositories:** all three  

Automate the architecture specification's acceptance matrix in development, including lock refusal,
mount identity, lineage mismatch, prefix authorization, acknowledgement-crash recovery, agent/control
capacity isolation, old-handle generation behavior, agent terminal/lease races, HTTP latency envelope,
DS task recreation, engine stop-confirm-start, and cohort rollback. Repeat the storage/performance
subset twice on production-shaped resources before enabling the production employee cohort.

The provisional same-AZ HTTP objective remains a measurement target, not a promise: matched-trace
transport overhead below both 1 ms p99 and 25% of append p99. Preserve raw samples and configuration;
do not subtract independently aggregated percentiles.

### ROLL-01 — Enable the internal cohort

**Depends on:** `QUAL-01`  
**Repository:** `indexed`

Enable dev staff first. Then deploy the same pinned images and versioned profile to the production
account with flags off, run smoke/recovery checks, and enable a named employee cohort. Roll back the
two flags independently. A rollback never deletes the DS volume, resets a store generation, drops the
incumbent Electric slot, or rebinds an old client offset to a new physical stream.

## 5. First execution wave

Start only:

1. `EC-01` in `electric-circuits`; and
2. `DS-01` in `durable-streams-rust`.

Review their shared JSON identity contract before either merges. Then start `DS-02`, `EC-02`, and
`EC-03` in parallel. Infrastructure and product work begin only after `DS-02` and `EC-02` make their
storage, access, and handoff contracts executable. `EC-03` gates only future code that consumes the
in-process transaction seam. This prevents Pulumi, gateway, and iOS code from hard-coding guessed
storage or path behavior.

## 6. Explicit non-goals for the pilot

- no separate ingestor ECS service;
- no active/candidate query engine overlap;
- no second Durable Streams writer on the volume;
- no ECS service-managed EBS volume;
- no EFS, S3 hot WAL, hosted Durable Streams, Multi-Attach, or multi-AZ failover claim;
- no client-to-storage credentials or direct client DS endpoint;
- no replacement of the incumbent Electric path for non-employees; and
- no scheduler, exported lifecycle-control API, temporary CLI fixture, or generated trust-input work
  as part of this delivery plan.
